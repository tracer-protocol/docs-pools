## Market Deployment

The easiest way to deploy new markets is by using the [Tracer Factory](../factory/pools-factory.md). It's a no-code tool that allows the same deployment capabilities as using the Perpetual Pools v2 Factory smart contract. Please see [Contract Addresses](../contract-addresses.md) for the Factory smart contract address.

## Technical Explanations

{% hint style="info" %}
This part of the Tracer Docs is still incomplete.&#x20;

If you think you could create an extensive technical explanation and development guide based on the Tracer Smart Contracts, please join the Engineering working group via the #contribute channel on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/TracerDAO).
