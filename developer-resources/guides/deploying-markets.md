## Market Deployment

The easiest way to deploy new markets is by using the [Tracer Factory](../factory/pools-factory.md). It's a no-code tool that allows the same deployment capabilities as using the Perpetual Pools v2 Factory smart contract. Please see [Contract Addresses](../contract-addresses.md) for the Factory smart contract address.
