# Development Guide

Welcome to the Tracer Development Guide. This page provides links & resources for everything you need to build on top of and integrate with Tracer. It is recommended you familiarise yourself with the [Perpetual Pool's mechanism](../advanced-topics/mechanism/README.md) before beginning development.

## Market Deployment

The easiest way to deploy new markets is by using the [Tracer Factory](../../factory/pools-factory/). It's a no-code tool that allows the same deployment capabilities as using the Perpetual Pools v2 Factory smart contract. Please see [Contract Addresses](../../contract-addresses.md) for the Factory smart contract address.
