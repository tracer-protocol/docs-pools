# 7. Provide Liquidity on Balancer & Stake BPTs

Pool tokens can also be invested into Liquidity Pools on Balancer to assist the functionality of the secondary markets for Tracer pool tokens. Liquidity providers will receive Balancer Pool Tokens (BPTs) in exchange for their investment. BPTs earn swap fees on Balancer, and can be staked in Tracer staking farms to earn additional TCR. Read on to learn how!&#x20;

Note: Liquidity providers on Balancer are exposed to a risk known as Impermanent Loss. To learn more about Impermanent Loss you can start [here.](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/impermanent-loss-explained)
