### What are Perpetual Pools?

Perpetual Pools are tools for making **leveraged tokens**. They have been designed with simplicity in mind, so making and redeeming the tokens with Pools is easy.&#x20;

### What are Leveraged Tokens?

Leveraged tokens, or _Pools tokens_, track your favourite assets but outperform them by a multiple.&#x20;

For example, we have a Perpetual Pool tracking the cryptocurrency ether (ETH) with approximately 3 times the returns. It's used to create **long** tokens that rise and fall in value with the price of ether, and **short** tokens that rise and fall in opposition to the price of ether.

Generally, any asset can have leveraged tokens that track it. If youâ€™re interested in making a Perpetual Pools market for a specific asset, go on ahead to the [Factory](../factory/pools-factory/) section of these docs.&#x20;
