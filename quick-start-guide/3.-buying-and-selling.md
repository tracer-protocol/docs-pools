# 3. Open a Position

There are two ways to open a position using Perpetual Pools:&#x20;

1. **Mint** a pool token natively **on Tracer**, or&#x20;
2. **Buy** a pool token **on the secondary market (**[**Balancer**](https://arbitrum.balancer.fi/#/)**)**.&#x20;

Luckily, our app allows you to do both, and is able to direct you to the [Balancer](https://arbitrum.balancer.fi/#/) token you're after in a few clicks.&#x20;

### The Buy Page

The **Buy page** is where you first arrive when the app launches. It features an order form which generates your pool token order based on your inputs.

#### **Select Market**

Start filling it out by choosing a _Market_. The market field determines the asset your tokens will track. There's a bunch of markets under the dropdown:

#### **Select Side**

After you've chosen the market, pick a _Side_. This will determine whether you get a **long** token or **short** token:

Remember that long tokens profit when the asset's price goes up and short tokens profit when the assets price goes down.
{% endhint %}

#### **Select Leverage**

Next, consider the multiple you want the tokens to outperform your chosen asset by. The _Leverage_ bar shows which levels are available.

#### **Select Market Type**

In some cases, an additional drop down will appear called _Market type._&#x20;

If you see this dropdown, it means that more than one pool exists for the market and leverage you have inputted. The dropdown lists the pool parameters for the duplicate pools. Select the parameters that you're after.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The creator of a pool has the ability to set a bunch of pool parameters that will determine how the pool tokens perform. Learn about these parameters in the ['Deploy a New Market' tutorial](https://pools.docs.tracer.finance/tutorials/tutorials/deploying-a-new-market). &#x20;
{% endhint %}

#### Enter Spend Amount

Now, enter the amount you'd like to spend. The interface will display the pool token that you're after.&#x20;

#### Open the Position

Finally, decide if you want to mint the pool tokens natively on Tracer, or buy the pool tokens instantly on Balancer.&#x20;

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="I selected 'Mint on Tracer'" %}
Before you finish and sign-off on the transaction in your wallet, you'll notice a countdown timer. This is how long you have before your tokens are minted and ready to claim.&#x20;

When you're happy, complete your order by clicking 'Mint on Tracer'.&#x20;



{% hint style="info" %}
You might have to "unlock" funds before you’re given the option to buy the tokens. Don't worry – you only have to do it once for each [settlement](../glossary.md) asset.
{% endhint %}



There's a number of notifications to let you know that your mint was successful. The first looks like this:

Don't worry about waiting around until your tokens ready, we'll hold them in escrow for you. You'll be able to claim them from the portfolio page once the countdown has elapsed.&#x20;
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="I selected 'Take me to Balancer'" %}
If you want your pool tokens right away, it's best to buy them on Balancer.&#x20;

Selecting 'Take me to Balancer' will open a new tab to the Balancer pool that will allow you to buy the pool tokens.&#x20;



{% hint style="info" %}
You might have to "unlock" funds before you’re given the option to buy the tokens. Don't worry – you only have to do it once for each [settlement](../glossary.md) asset.
{% endhint %}



Once your transaction has successfully executed, the tokens will live in your Web3 wallet. You might not see them at first if you haven't added the pool token to your wallet. You can view the addresses of each pool token [here](https://pools.docs.tracer.finance/advanced-topics/markets-arbitrum-one) and manually add them to your wallet!&#x20;
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}



## Selling a Pool Token

If you want to cash in a leveraged token right away, it's best to sell it on a secondary market. The selling process is much the same as buying: you first need to go the Balancer order form on the "Tokens" page. Start by changing the form from _Buy_ to _Sell_.

The Sell form shows all the Pools tokens you hold in your wallet. If you have more than are displayed and want to sell a token that isn't shown, you can search for it above the token summary. Choose the token you want to sell by clicking on it.

Then, enter the amount you want to sell. The form will calculate the expected value you'll get for that number of tokens, and any fees you have to pay. When you're ready to review the order, click the button at the bottom of the form to bring up the summary.

When you're happy, complete your order by clicking Sell. You'll need to sign off on the transaction in your wallet. After it's submitted, you'll get a notification that your order is pending.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Selling Pool Tokens on the secondary market may not be possible if there is not enough secondary market liquidity. If you are planning to sell, not burn, your tokens, please check that the market you are entering has sufficient liquidity.
{% endhint %}

> That's it for buying and selling on the Tracer app. If you are looking for other ways to buy and sell Pools tokens, there's a list of secondary markets in the FAQs.
