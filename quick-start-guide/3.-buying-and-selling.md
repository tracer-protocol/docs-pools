# 3. Buying and Selling

## Buying a Pool Token

If you want a leveraged token right away, it's best to buy it on a secondary market. Luckily, our app has integrated [Balancer](https://arbitrum.balancer.fi/#/) markets you can trade on, without having to leave the "Tokens" page.

{% hint style="info" %}
We've setup the Balancer portfolios to make money for LP's. Find out how you can provide liquidity and earn rewards in the [Use Cases](../advanced-topics/use-cases.md) section.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

The Tokens page is where you first arrive when the app launches. Its main feature is the Balancer order form, which generates your Pools token order. Start filling it out by choosing a _Market_.&#x20;

The market field determines the asset your tokens will track. There's a bunch of markets under the dropdown (and sometimes multiple for the same asset):&#x20;

After you've chosen the market, pick a _Side_. This will determine whether you get a **long** token or **short** token:

Remember that long tokens profit when the asset's price goes up and short tokens profit when the assets price goes down.&#x20;

Next, consider the multiple you want the tokens to outperform your chosen asset by. The _Leverage_ bar shows which levels are available:

{% hint style="danger" %}
Be careful using high leverage. Although you can't be liquidated using a Pools token, leverage accelerates losses as well as profits.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

All that's left to do is enter the amount you'd like to spend. Some Pools tokens can only be purchased with certain kinds of funds, so check that you have the right type by looking through the dropdown on the right:

When you're ready to review the order, click the button at the bottom of the form to bring up the summary:&#x20;

The order summary shows the token you're buying, its current price, and how many you will receive. It also tells you the exposure you'll gain if you go ahead with the purchase. Exposure is how much of the tracked asset the tokens will act like.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
You might have to "unlock" funds before you’re given the option to buy the tokens. Don't worry – you only have to do it once for each [settlement](../glossary.md) asset. &#x20;
{% endhint %}

When you're happy, complete your order by clicking buy. You'll need to sign off on the transaction in your wallet. After it's submitted, you'll get a notification that your order is pending:

While you wait for confirmation, you can add the Pools token to your wallet's asset list by clicking the notification's top link.&#x20;

## Selling a Pool Token

If you want to cash in a leveraged token right away, it's best to sell it on a secondary market. The selling process is much the same as buying: you first need to go the Balancer order form on the "Tokens" page. Start by changing the form from _Buy_ to _Sell_.&#x20;

The Sell form shows all the Pools tokens you hold in your wallet. If you have more than are displayed and want to sell a token that isn't shown, you can search for it above the token summary. Choose the token you want to sell by clicking on it.

Then, enter the amount you want to sell. The form will calculate the expected value you'll get for that number of tokens, and any fees you have to pay. When you're ready to review the order, click the button at the bottom of the form to bring up the summary.

When you're happy, complete your order by clicking Sell. You'll need to sign off on the transaction in your wallet. After it's submitted, you'll get a notification that your order is pending.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Selling Pool Tokens on the secondary market may not be possible if there is not enough secondary market liquidity. If you are planning to sell, not burn, your tokens, please check that the market you are entering has sufficient liquidity.
