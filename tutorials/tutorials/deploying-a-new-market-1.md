# Displaying Custom Markets

By default, factory-deployed markets are not shown on the [pools.tracer.finance](https://pools.tracer.finance/) web application. If there's market that you would like to view on the front-end, you can:

1. Display the market manually using the "Display Alternative Pool" feature, or;
2. Request to have a market listed by default on the front-end via governance vote.&#x20;

This guide explains how to manually display your custom market via the "Display Alternative Pool" feature. To learn how to request to have a factory-deployed market listed on the front-end by default, read the guide: ['Adding a Market to the App'.](https://pools.docs.tracer.finance/factory/pools-factory/adding-a-market-to-the-app)

### How to Display a Custom Market

Head to [https://pools.tracer.finance/pools/](https://pools.tracer.finance/pools/) and scroll to the bottom of the page. Select the 'Display Alternative Pool' button.&#x20;
