# ðŸ˜© Troubleshooting

**I minted a token but I cannot see it in my portfolio**

This is most likely an RPC issue. We recommend you try another RPC endpoint by changing your browser wallet's network settings. For more information, please refer to Offchain Labs' documentation [here](https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/mainnet#getting-started).

If the issue is not resolved, please open your console log and see if there are error messages. You can reach out to us on Discord for more help.

**I cannot see a market on the website anymore**

It is possible that the market you have interacted previously with has been removed from the front end. You can add any market to the front end by navigating to the Trade -page _(Pools -page_), scrolling down to the bottom and clicking the "Display Alternative Market" -button. This will open up a prompt in which you can copy the right "Leveraged Pool" address from the [Markets -page](advanced-topics/markets-arbitrum-one/).
